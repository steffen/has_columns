HasColumns
==========

A Rails plugin that delegates access of association's attributes (including the association's association's attributes, see example).


Support versions
=======
This plugin has been a while in production with a Rails 2.1 application.
Other versions are not tested, but may work.


Use Case
=======

This comes handy for exporting CSV or transforming your records to JSON.


Example
=======

class Employee < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_columns :from => :position
end

class Report < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_columns :from => :employee
end

You can access the associations's attributes the following way:

@report = Report.first
puts @report.employee_name
puts @report.employee_position_name


You can transform your records easily to JSON:

@report.to_json(:methods => [:employee_name, :employee_position_name])


Credits
=======

This plugin is based on http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/ar_delegation by Dave Verwer.
I changed:
- It delegates all attributes by default, you can narrow down via the :only and :except option.
- It delegates attributes of the association's delegated attributes. Like employee.position.name to employee_position_name, see example.
